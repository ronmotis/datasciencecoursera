# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for 
# complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate 
# for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases 
# (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. The function should 
# return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold 
# requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the 
# function should return a numeric vector of length 0. A prototype of this 
# function follows

# 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
# the location of the CSV files

# 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
# number of completely observed observations (on all
# variables) required to compute the correlation between
# nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0

# Return a numeric vector of correlations
